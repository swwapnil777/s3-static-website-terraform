Hereâ€™s the updated `README.md` for your repository named `s3-static-website-terraform`:


# S3 Static Website Deployment with Terraform

This project demonstrates how to deploy a simple static website to Amazon S3 using Terraform. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Terraform
- An AWS account

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/s3-static-website-terraform.git
   cd s3-static-website-terraform
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and add your AWS credentials and region:

   ```dotenv
   # .env
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
   AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
   ```

3. **Source the `.env` File**

   Load the environment variables from the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   source .env
   ```

4. **Initialize Terraform**

   Run the following command to initialize the Terraform configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

5. **Apply Terraform Configuration**

   Apply the Terraform configuration to set up the S3 bucket and deploy your static website:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Follow the prompts to review and confirm the changes.

6. **Verify the Endpoint**

   After Terraform has finished applying the configuration, check the endpoint for your static website. The output from Terraform will include the endpoint URL, which will look something like this:

   ```plaintext
   Outputs:

   website_endpoint = "http://your-static-website-url"
   ```

   Visit this URL in your web browser to see your deployed static website.
